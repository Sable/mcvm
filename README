DISCLAIMER
==========

This is a past version of McVM, with some parts that are work-in-progress and
not fully working.

BUILD IT
========

The easiest way to compile is to use the bootstrap.sh,
which will populate the /vendor directory with
LLVM and Boehm GC (it already contains Eigen matrix
library in lib/).

Some useful definitions are :
* MCVM_USE_LAPACKE (recommended)
* MCVM_USE_CLAPACK
